In Python, the `.print()` function is used to output/display the specified message or value(s) onto the console or standard output. It is used to print the provided data as a string, and it automatically adds a newline character at the end.

Here is a basic syntax of the `.print()` function:

```python
print(value1, value2, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```

- `value1, value2, ...` are the values or expressions to be printed. You can pass multiple arguments to print, which will be displayed with space separators by default.

- `sep=' '` is an optional argument that specifies the separator between the values. By default, it is set to a space character.

- `end='\n'` is also an optional argument that defines what will be printed after all the values are displayed. By default, it is set to a newline character.

- `file=sys.stdout` is used to specify the file object where the values are printed. By default, it is set to the standard output (console).

- `flush=False` is an optional argument that defines whether the output should be flushed immediately or not. By default, it is set to `False`.

Here are some examples of using the `.print()` function:

```python
# Printing a single value
print("Hello, World!")

# Printing multiple values separated by a custom separator
print("Hello", "World", sep=", ")

# Printing without a new line
print("Hello, ", end='')
print("World!")

# Redirecting output to a file
file = open("output.txt", "w")
print("Hello, World!", file=file)
file.close()
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
Hello, World
Hello, World!
```

Note: In Python 3.x, `.print()` is a function, while in Python 2.x, it is treated as a statement. In Python 2.x, parentheses are not always required when using `.print()` statement.
